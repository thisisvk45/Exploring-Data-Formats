# Exploring-Data-Formats

In this task, we will explore various data formats, and plotting techniques. To appreciate the challenges posed by big data, a sufficiently large
dataset is necessary. Also, the data should be of good quality. We picked
a dataset of used cars advertised on Craigslist (a free site for advertising
things): Kaggle dataset. It is a CSV file that is 1.45 GB uncompressed,
but the zipped version is just 275 MB. You can download it from this link:
download. This dataset has a usability score of 10.0 as it one of the better
documented datasets on Kaggle. Download this data, and extract the vehicles.csv to a folder of your
choice.
